## Setting Up the Raspberry Pi
### Imaging the SD Card:
**IMPORTANT**: This Project uses the RPi OS "Buster", newer OS's have not been confirmed to work.
#### Imaging an SD Card with Raspbian Buster on Windows 10:
* Download Raspbian Buster from the Raspberry Pi Download Site[^1]
  * The version used here is 2021-05-07-raspios-buster-armhf.img
* Unzip the Archived Image
* Insert a blank MicroSD card into your computer
* Use an imaging software to format and image the card
  * The application used to image the card here is Rufus[^2]
  * If the card isn't accessible after the first image, re-image the card.
### Post-Imaging Pre-Boot Setup (Optional Steps):
**All of the following steps should be done within the Boot Folder once the SD card is imaged. None of these steps are required, but they make the first boot of the Pi much simpler**
* Enable SSH by Default
  * Add a plain text file called **SSH**, with no file extension. This file has been provided here in the directory "Files to Add to SD Card Boot Folder Post-Image"
* Manually Connect to Wifi
  * Add a file called **wpa_supplicant.conf**. This file has been provided here in the directory "Files to Add to SD Card Boot Folder Post-Image"
  * Open the file and change "YOUR_NETWORK_NAME" to your wireless network's SSID, and "YOUR_PASSWORD" to your wireless network's password. This setup requires the network you're connecting to, to be using WPA-PSK security.
* Adjust Resolution (If using a remote desktop client)
  * Open the file **config.txt**
  * Uncomment the line ```hdmi_force_hotplug=1```
  * Uncomment the line ```hdmi_group=1```
  * Uncomment the line ```hdmi_mode=1 and change the value to 16```
  * Add the following line to the end of the file ```hdmi_ignore_edid=0xa5000080```
### First Boot Setup:
**All of the following steps are done via command line**
* Assuming the Pi is connected to the network, SSH to it using the default username and password for Raspbian
  * Username: Pi
  * Password: raspberry
* Change the default password using the following command:
  * ```passwd```
* Install Updates
  * ```sudo apt-get update```
  * ```sudo apt-get dist-upgrade``` (This can take up to an hour)
* Enable I2C peripheral
  * Open the Raspbery Pi Config File
    * ```sudo raspi-config```
  * Navigate to Interface Options > I2C
  * Select Yes to enable VNC Server
  * Select Finish
  * Restarting the Pi after this change is recommended. Run this command if not prompted
    * ```sudo shutdown -r```
  * Check that the user-mode I2C interface is now available
    * Running ```ls /dev/*i2c*```
    * Should result in the response ```/dev/i2c-1```
* Install the I2C command line utility programs if they aren't already installed
  * ```sudo apt-get-install -y i2c-tools```

**Optional Steps**
* Enable VNC Access
  * Open the Raspbery Pi Config File
    * ```sudo raspi-config```
  * Navigate to Interface Options > VNC
  * Select Yes to enable VNC Server
  * Select Finish
* Set Python3 as default
  * Open the .bashrc file
    * ```sudo nano ~/.bashrc```
  * Type the following on a new line at the end of the file
    * ```alias python=python3```
  * Save and exit the file
  * Run the following command to make the alias permanent
    * ```source ~/.bashrc```

### Interacting with the I2C Devices connected to the Pi
**The following steps assume a hardware setup identical to the provided schematic**
* Confirm the I2C Mux peripheral is present on the bus
  * ```pi@sensorhub:~ $ i2cdetect -y 1
     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  a  b  c  d  e  f
