How the program should work:

A log file is created with headers to hold sensor readings

Every 60 seconds
	The sensors are read
	The data is passed through Marzullo's Algorithm
		Data is passed to Marzullo as +/- intervals
		Data is returned as a Median value
	The resulting output is
		Written to a log file
			If any entry is over 7 days old, that entry is removed.
			Either
				Expired entries at top are removed, and new entries added to bottom, pushing old up
				Expired entries at bottom are removed and new entries added to top, pushing old down
		Compared against thresholds
			Check if temp is out of range
				Soft Range: 20.5 - 21.5 Degrees Celsius
				Hard Range: 20 - 22 Degrees Celsius
			Check if humidity is out of range
				Soft Range: 40.0% - 50.0%
				Hard Range: 25.0% - 65.0%
			Check if humidity has changed move than 10% in 1 hour
				...
			Check if current lux is out of range
				Limit: > 200 Lux
			Check if cummulative lux (over 24 hour period) is out of range
				Max: > 1000 Lux Hours
					Either
						Sum the last 24 hours of entries in the logs
						Sum the values in an array hold 24 hours of entries

Checking every 60 seconds means:
	60 entries per hour
	1,440 entries per day
	10,080 entries per week

For testing we can scale readings and thresholds to make problems visble quicker
